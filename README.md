:vampire: : isn't this corpse exquisite? <br>

L'Étrange Noël de monsieur Jack <br>
Trying to push when I should pull... I feel like a gym bro :muscle:

If a butterfly flip its wings in one part of the world,
it is able to cause storm in another part. <br>
Sounds weird, right?

A :door: appeared on the horizon, shimmering like heat
but leading to a place colder than winter’s breath. :snowflake:

<br>
But if you find that butterfly and ask it not to flip its wings... <br>
...does that mean there will be no storm? <br>
I am confused. : :confused: <br>
